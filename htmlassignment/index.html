      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is <em>Kristi Nallbani</em>. My preferred pronouns are she/her. I am from Albania, and it is almost my 26<sup>th</sup> year living in Canada. My favourite colours are blue, green, purple and yellow.</p>
      <p>My hobbies are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Travelling</li>
        <li>Taking photographs</li>
        <li>Watching movies</li>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
      </ul>  
      <p>I am taking the Interactive Media Design program to improve my fundamental media design skills and learn to use digital tools to produce new artwork. This program will prepare me for many career paths that I can pursue. I have a strong passion for photography and videography, and by adding digital design to my skill set, I can further my career in photography and other related fields of work. In this course, I hope to learn web design using the code languages <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. I am interested in the whole process. I'm excited to explore this program.</p>
